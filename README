Steve's simple socket library

(c) Copyright 2012, Steve Anderson.


This does TCP/IP only (no UDP) and was originally written to abstract
the icky details of setting up and using sockets for simple IPC.

socklib.c - holds all the wrapper functions around *nix socket calls.
socklib.h - include file for the simple socket library.
server.c - a test program, a server that listens and prints out data sent to it.
client.c - a test program, lets you type in to stdin and sends that to the above server.

See the comment in ssocklib.h for an overview of how to use the library, or the code
in the server.c and client.c programs.

To build:

    - see the Makefile. Originally developed on Ubuntu Linux, also tested on my Mac.
    - Should just be able to 'make all'

To test or demonstrate:
    
    - complile the server and client programs (see Makefile)
    - to test on a single computer, run the server program in one shell window,
      and then run one or more clients in other shell windows (all connecting to
      "localhost" and using the same port.
    - then type something in the client input and see it echoed by the server.


To do:
    - add UDP support
    - add wrappers for send() and recv() (maybe message()?)
    - add threads to the server sample
    - add two-way communication to the demo
    - test on more versions of linux/unix
